# Hi, I'm Martin 👋

🚀 **Researcher & PhD Candidate** @ Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin  
🪴 **Building Debugging Tools** to enhance software reliability and development efficiency  
🔭 **Currently Working On:**

- [FandangoLearn](https://github.com/martineberlein/fandango-learn) – A invariant learner mining input specifications that distinguish between accepted and rejected inputs.
- [Avicenna](https://github.com/martineberlein/avicenna) – A tool for explaining input circumstances that trigger pathological program behavior, i.e., bugs.
- [EvoGFuzz](https://github.com/martineberlein/evogfuzzplusplus) – An evolutionary grammar-based fuzzer for generating effective test inputs.
